### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**
I am an aspiring software engineer enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science and business administration.

My interests include using specialized data structures and algorithms to solve business problems and presenting difficult concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to learn, adapt, and jump across verticals to deliver high-performing solutions.

I'm graduating in April 2026 and I'm interested in full-time software engineering roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at johnbenedictyan@u.nus.edu.sg
