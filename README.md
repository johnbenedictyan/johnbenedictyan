### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a software engineer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science and business administration.

<!-- My interests include using specialized data structures and algorithms to solve business problems and presenting difficult concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to learn, adapt, and jump across verticals to deliver high-performing solutions.

I'm graduating in April 2026 and I'm interested in full-time software engineering roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at johnbenedictyan@u.nus.edu.sg
